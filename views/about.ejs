        <p class="align-left">
            I'm originally from Michigan, and went to the University of Michigan where I received my B.S.E in Chemical Engineering.<br>
            I started my career in tech working as a Technical Services Analyst for Epic Systems, Inc. (healthcare Epic, not gaming Epic) 
            where I realized I was interested in making coding/designing/debugging/etc. more of a central focus of my career.<br>
            I still enjoy interacting with customers, managing projects, and providing direction (core to my role at Epic), and hope to continue doing it in the future!<br>
            I'm working on making my full-time programming career a reality by working towards my M.S Computer Science at University of Wisconsin - Madison.
